# simpleSocialNetwork

User should put those files provided on some server (I've used WAMP for developing purposes) and start the app by navigating to "SimpleSocialNetwork.html" file. 

The list of all users are provided and by clicking on user details are displayed along with friends and friends suggestion (friends suggestion is going to be developed in next few days).
