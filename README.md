# simpleSocialNetwork

User should put those files provided on some server (I've used WAMP for developing purposes) and start the app by navigating to "SimpleSocialNetwork.html" file. Otherwise CORS error might occur.

The list of all users are provided and by clicking on user details are displayed along with friends and friends suggestion (people who know 2 or more direct friends of the chosen user but are not directly connected to the chosen user).
